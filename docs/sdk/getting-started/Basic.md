## SubsocialApi

SubsocialApi creates a new connection to Subsocial API (includes Substrate and IPFS connections).

Using this class, you can get all the data of posts, spaces and profiles from blockchain storages and ipfs with appropriate methods.

```
SubsocialApi(props: SubsocialApiProps): SubsocialApi
```

> ðŸ†ƒ SubsocialApiProps: [*SubsocialContext*](https://docs.subsocial.network/js-docs/js-sdk/modules.html#subsocialcontext) & { ipfsNodeUrl: *string*, offchainUrl: *string*, substrateApi: *SubstrateApi* }

## SubsocialSubstrateApi

SubsocialSubstrateApi is a wrapper for connecting to a Subsocial Node with functions from Subsocial Pallets wrapped in convenient methods to call.

```
SubsocialSubstrateApi(props: SubstrateApiProps): SubsocialSubstrateApi
```

> ðŸ†ƒ SubstrateApiProps:  [*SubsocialContext*](https://docs.subsocial.network/js-docs/js-sdk/modules.html#subsocialcontext) & { api: *SubstrateApi*  }

## SubsocialIpfsApi

Aggregated API to work with IPFS: get the content of the spaces of posts and profiles.

```
SubsocialIpfsApi(props: SubsocialIpfsProps): SubsocialIpfsApi
```

> ðŸ†ƒ [SubsocialIpfsProps](https://docs.subsocial.network/js-docs/js-sdk/modules/api.html#subsocialipfsprops): [*SubsocialContext*](https://docs.subsocial.network/js-docs/js-sdk/modules.html#subsocialcontext) & { ipfsNodeUrl: *IpfsUrl*; offchainUrl: *string* }

## off-chain

Off-chain is a storage where data is built on the basis of blockchain events. This allows to conveniently perform work that the blockchain itself does not allow.

It saves text data of blogs, posts and comments to IPFS. Builds user feeds and notifications in Postgres. Supports full text search by indexing text data into ElasticSeach database.

## IPFS

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/) is a decentralized storage network commonly used by blockchain projects looking for a storage solution. It is similar to a torrent network where users download content to their machines, and upload it to people that wish to access it. IPFS node operators are able to choose what content they host on their node. Subsocial uses IPFS for multimedia storage.
