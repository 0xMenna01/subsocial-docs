To install the SDK, run:

```
yarn add @subsocial/api
```

Also, you will need to install additional packages for using type definitions and helper methods.

```
yarn add @subsocial/types @subsocial/definitions @subsocial/utils
```

> :exclamation: In order to correctly build the application, Yarn needs to be used. If you try to use NPM, you may face issues with some NPM packages.
