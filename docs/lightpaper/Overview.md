Subsocial is an open platform that allows anyone to launch their own decentralized
censorship-resistant social networks and marketplaces. Subsocial will help you create your own
decentralized version of the popular sites we see today, such as Medium, Twitter, Reddit,
Instagram, Discourse, Patreon, OnlyFans and more.

Our software uses the Substrate blockchain framework and IPFS for decentralized file storage.
This enables personalized news feed and notifications, transparent reputation, full text
searching, rich content formats, without sacrificing SEO (search engine optimization).

Using Substrate also allows Subsocial to connect to the Polkadot and Kusama networks.
Polkadot is a next-generation blockchain protocol that unites an entire network of purpose-built
blockchains, allowing them to interoperate seamlessly at scale. Polkadot will provide
cross-chain interaction as well as providing a shared security platform upon which Subsocial
can scale whilst remaining secure.

Subsocial is social media unbounded.
