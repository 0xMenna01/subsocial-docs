title: Parachain vs Parathread
---

> A chain developed with Substrate can at different points in its lifetime assume one of three
states: an independent chain with a secured bridge, a parachain, or a parathread. ([source](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/ru/learn-parathreads))

Subsocial has acquired one of Kusama's parachain slots, in addition to operating a standalone chain.
Users will be able to lock tokens on the parachain in order to earn free transactions on the standalone chain, 
but the exact mechanism for this is still in development.

There are currently no plans for a Polkadot parachain, but the option is still available for the future.

Should Subsocial fail to secure a parachain slot in the future, that chain will transition to a parathread.
