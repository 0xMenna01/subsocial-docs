title: Parachain vs Parathread

> A chain developed with Substrate can at different points in its lifetime assume one of three
states: an independent chain with a secured bridge, a parachain, or a parathread. ([source](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/ru/learn-parathreads))

Subsocial is currently planning to acquire one of Kusama's parachain slots, in addition to operating a standalone chain.
These two chains will be connected by a bridge, and will share the same token.

There are currently no plans for a Polkadot parachain, but the option is still available for the future.
